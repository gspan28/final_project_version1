 My final project entails using Yelp data to analyze the best date spots in various popular US cities, including Boston, New York, and Los Angeles. I am interested in learning about what types of activities are most popular (descriptive) and why (causal/inferential). 
 
 In order to gather the data, I need to complete two steps: a) scraping Yelp data, and b) detecting strings of keywords relevant to date spots.
